# Security Policy

This Security Policy was last updated on August 18, 2024 and applies to citizens and permanent residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland.

## Technical and organizational measures

We use technical and organizational measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal data we process. These include, among others:

- **Access restrictions:** Only authorized team members have access to the data according to the V-Code classification.
- **Encryption:** We use end-to-end SSL encryption as standard for the transmission of sensitive data.
- **Server security:** We use strong firewalls and regularly monitor our servers for security breaches.
- **Security audits:** We carry out regular security audits to check the effectiveness of our security measures.

## Confidentiality system

### What are V-Codes?

The V-codes represent our internal code system for confidentiality levels and were originally created as part of cn23-Identity. They mark the level of confidentiality that certain data or resources have in relation to our work. The aim is to make it easier for ðŸ’™ WeMake team members to recognize and correctly handle sensitive information. The V-codes range from publicly available information (VC0) to closely guarded secrets (VC3).

### Public VC0

These documents can be easily distributed worldwide as they do not contain any confidential information.

### Internal VC1

These documents are intended exclusively for our team. They contain information about our daily work and internal projects. They may contain sensitive data, such as details of our technologies or operating procedures.

### Confidential VC2

These files contain sensitive information and are strictly confidential. They are only available to certain team members and may contain critical strategic data or upcoming business decisions.

### Secret VC3

This level is strictly confidential: only selected team members are allowed to view these documents. They contain sensitive information that must be protected at all costs and must never be made accessible to outsiders. The security protocols are strict and compliance is mandatory at all times. Any negligence can have serious consequences - for the person concerned, the team and the company as a whole.

## Data transmission

Data sent over the internet is not completely secure. While we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of your data, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data you transmit to us. Any transmission is at your own risk.

## Breach of data security

In the event of a data security breach where your personal data has been compromised, we will notify you as soon as possible. We will also take all necessary steps to rectify the breach and prevent it from happening again.

## Commitment of our team members and service providers

All our team members and service providers are required to comply with the security policy and procedures that we establish.

## Updates

We may occasionally change or update this Security Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to periodically review this policy to stay informed about our privacy practices.
